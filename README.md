# Pridict-Future-Stock-Prices# Task 2: Predict Future Stock Prices

[cite_start]This project is part of the AI/ML Engineering Internship at Developers Hub Corporation[cite: 135, 138]. [cite_start]The objective is to use historical stock market data to predict the next day's closing price for a selected asset [cite: 160-161].



## Objective
[cite_start]To build a regression model capable of forecasting short-term stock price movements using historical features like Open, High, Low, and Volume[cite: 161, 167].

## Dataset
- [cite_start]**Source**: Yahoo Finance [cite: 163]
- [cite_start]**Library**: `yfinance` [cite: 163]
- **Features**: Open, High, Low, Volume
- [cite_start]**Target**: Next Day's Close Price [cite: 167]

## Models Applied
- [cite_start]**Linear Regression**: A regression model was utilized to establish a relationship between historical market features and the target closing price[cite: 168].

## Key Results and Findings
- [cite_start]The model was evaluated by plotting actual closing prices against predicted values to visualize accuracy[cite: 169].
- [cite_start]The visualization demonstrates the model's ability to capture general trends in the stock price movement[cite: 174].

## Skills Demonstrated
- [cite_start]Time series data handling [cite: 171]
- [cite_start]Data fetching using APIs (`yfinance`) [cite: 173]
- [cite_start]Regression modeling with Scikit-Learn [cite: 172]
- [cite_start]Visual evaluation using `matplotlib` [cite: 174]
